You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:
  1. You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git
  repository, or
  2. You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

### 1. Turn a local dir in to git repo
Go inside folder you want to change into git repo and follow following commands-
```
1. git init
2. git add <filename>
3. git commit -m "some message"
```

### Clone a repo 
Go inside dir, where you want to clone new project and type following command-
```
git clone https://github.com/yogitaupadhyay/how_to_use_github

git clone https://github.com/yogitaupadhyay/how_to_use_github <someNewNameOfRepo>
```
